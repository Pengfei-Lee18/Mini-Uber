At the beginning, if the driver has already taken the order, he is allowed to change the vehicle information. 
This may cause a mismatch between the final information of the vehicle and the information required by the passenger. 
Therefore we do not allow the driver to make changes to the vehicle information after the driver has taken the order.

1.22.
If the owner makes changes to the trip information when there is a sharer, this can result in a situation 
where the destination does not match the destination of the sharer, or the time window of the sharer does 
not match the time requested by the owner. Therefore, we automatically cancel all sharer orders after the 
owner has modified the destination. After the owner has modified the time, it will automatically search for 
the mismatched sharer and cancel its order, and send an email notification.

Due to the setting of the form, the form for editing personal information may be submitted illegally. Therefore, 
we validate their submitted forms. But not all illegal cases are covered now.

1.24.
We did not encrypt the user's password, resulting in the user's password being in plaintext in the database. 
But due to time we could not correct it in time. We plan to store it in the database using hash encryption or 
some other encryption method.

1.26.
The user can make a reservation for a trip decades later, or the user can enter an illegitimate time window (latetime<earlytime) 
We have solved this problem by validating it in the form submission area.

1.27.
Now there may be a big delay after clicking "complete" or "confirm" button, because of the need to send an email. 
The user experience is not very good. In the future, we plan to make it an asynchronous command to reduce the response time.
